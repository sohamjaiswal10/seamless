# seamless
A service which will be able to provide a cloud save like functionality to games which don't support it via ftp.

## usage
the script is supposed to connect to your own ftp server with a user in it which can save files the user would need complete permissions of the home directory, filezilla makes this easy to achieve so I recommend filezilla server for windows but the official server package has given me problems earlier so use the one provided with XAMPP. Change config.ini according to your server location, username and password to be able to connect
