deleted interface from main.py from now.... focusing on functionality first
added games.ini to store game profiles, including save locations.
added changes to help me remember what I am changing.
=================================END========================================

=================================4==========================================
added backupall function to main.py (just for show for now) and also finished 
the logic for the fin function in main.py and added some handy comments, 
and made config.ini to store data about the ftp and the to be made database
added info in README.md to refer to from config.ini

This was a difficult one to crack... Not difficult, i was stupid at times, added
ability to backup shit while keeping the package as portable as i currently could
next is gonna be ability to restore game saves, that will be easier as i just need
to reverse the process, might also add a rudimentary interface. I wanted to make a
temp directory to handle all the files related to transfer but ftplib kept giving an 
error 550 SUPER ANNOYING. As a bonus added pathparser and namer to handle reaching 
a path utilizing games ini and namer handles the nomenclature of saves.

restorer as that as main feature...

You can get files from the ftp now (Technically), Still the important part of 
putting the files back in the location where thay are supposed to be (OVERWRITING)
remains but ig this much is enough for this commit, adding the feature in the next 
one prolly
