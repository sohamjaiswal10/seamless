=================================3=========================================
deleted interface from main.py from now.... focusing on functionality first
added games.ini to store game profiles, including save locations.
added changes to help me remember what I am changing.
=================================END========================================

=================================4==========================================
added backupall function to main.py (just for show for now) and also finished 
the logic for the fin function in main.py and added some handy comments, 
and made config.ini to store data about the ftp and the to be made database
added info in README.md to refer to from config.ini
================================END==========================================

=================================5===========================================
This was a difficult one to crack... Not difficult, i was stupid at times, added
ability to backup shit while keeping the package as portable as i currently could
next is gonna be ability to restore game saves, that will be easier as i just need
to reverse the process, might also add a rudimentary interface. I wanted to make a
temp directory to handle all the files related to transfer but ftplib kept giving an 
error 550 SUPER ANNOYING. As a bonus added pathparser and namer to handle reaching 
a path utilizing games ini and namer handles the nomenclature of saves.
==================================END=========================================

================================5.5===========================================
Tested satability of backerupper lol, got idea of custom savenames, so started 
restorer as that as main feature...
===============================END============================================

==================================6===========================================
You can get files from the ftp now (Technically), Still the important part of 
putting the files back in the location where thay are supposed to be (OVERWRITING)
remains but ig this much is enough for this commit, adding the feature in the next 
one prolly
==================================END=========================================

===================================7==========================================
Dispatcher function added which dispatches the saves to the location where they 
should be and deletes the temporary transfer zip which previously would've remained
in the cwd (Useless lil' pieces of shit) now the interface remains.... finally
the basics of the backend are done at lucky change 7! Up next will be the interface 
of all this shit.
==================================END==========================================

You guys must've thought I was done for today, huh? WRONG 4th major commit of today
seperated archiving functions to a different module of it's own and made misctools
module for well... misctools. AND created a sorta functional interface for noobs it's
not tested yet but I am pretty sure it will work... also now there will be a seperate
folder for every user with a different username on pc, m gonna make an override for it
next, cuz while setting up an environment for what i am assuming to be different users
might just be one and it will be a major pain in the butt if that person cant access
his/her files (The shit this program is supposed to provide), thus the override feature
is gonna be real important.

=====================================8.5==============================================
Made it such that it does not crash without a connection from config.ini
====================================END===============================================

=============================9: THE BUG CRUSHER UPDATE================================
Eliminated almost all bugs from interface. Still thinking about the ftp browser i had mentioned
would be difficult to implement. Also, changed the folder structure from user>saves>gamename>savefile
to saves>gamename>savefile as the user folder can be managed by the ftp server itself and this user stuff
was overcomplicating stuff.
